# Use the files below to compare the fires that have been burning in California between
# Sept 1-13 and Sept 14 - 20. This file contains information about the latitude and longitude,
# and the brightness of each fire. Using what you have learnt in processing a JSON files
# and mapping, make a map that shows the fires. You will need separate programs to represent
# each JSON file. One file is from 9-1-20 to 9-13-20 and the other is from 9-14-20 to 9-20-20.
#  We are only interested in fires that have a brightness factor above 450.
